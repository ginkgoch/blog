tag: [ map, shapefile, gis tools ]

Many feedback indicate that the [getting started sample](https://github.com/ginkgoch/map-quick-started-demos) is too simple. Yes, I agree. Here comes 20+ downloadable and executable feature demos are available. Also released with new MAP SDK version v1.12.0 with many API improvements as well as some new functions.
<!-- more --> 

## v1.12.0 Change Logs
* Add `ViewportUtils.getInitViewport` function to get a proper lng, lat, zoom from envelope
* Allow to build geometries with number arrays for easier number input. e.g. `new LineString([{x:0, y:0}, {x:10, y:10}])` becomes `LineString.fromNumbers([0, 0, 10, 10])`
* Implement query function on FeatureSource which allows to query features based on spatial relationship: `intersect`, `disjoint`, `within`, `overlap` and `touch`
* Add declare file (*.d.ts) for native register for better typescript support
* Fix a bug of a returning type is bind to another libâ€™s specific version, which makes typescript upstream project compile filed
* Add a strategy to auto break down values by its index position. Previously, it breaks down by value, when the maximum value is far away from the second large value, the effect is not good.
* Allow to create new delimited file with specified features.

## Feature Demos
Learning feature with demos will be a pretty easy way to get started. Before learning from source code, a better approach is to take a look at what it can be done with an executable application.

This feature demo application is built with `electron` that support to run on `macOS`, `Windows` and `Linux`.
